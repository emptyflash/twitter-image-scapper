# twitter-image-scapper
puppeteer script for downloading images from a profile

*THIS DOES NOT DOWNLOAD ANYWHERE NEAR ALL OF THE IMAGES*

My hope was that it would get more than the twitter API 
allows (around 3000), but unfortunately I've only see 
this approach get around 300.

I found [this](https://github.com/bpb27/twitter_scraping) 
utility, which gets around the 3000 and 300 limit by using
date ranges with search. It only retrieves the ids of the
tweets, so I should probably use this approach, but go ahead
and download the photos.
